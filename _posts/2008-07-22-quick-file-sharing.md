First drop an alias -
{% highlight bash %}
alias qshare='python -c "import SimpleHTTPServer;SimpleHTTPServer.test()"' {% endhighlight %}
into your  bash profile.
Then whenever you  want to share the contents of a folder with somebody, changing
the directory to the appropriate folder and running  "qshare", youâ€™ve got yourself a
webserver running on port 8000 with directory listing enabled.
